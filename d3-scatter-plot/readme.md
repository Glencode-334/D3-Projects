Using movie box-office data from boxofficemojo.com, this chart plots:

  The number of movie tickets sold each year from 2000-2014 (y axis) against the number of major-release movies each year   (x axis)
  
  Average ticket price per year is indicated with a label next to each circle and is reflected in the size of the circles.
  
  Axes labels and legend are added with html/css.
